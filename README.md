# Ontology for User Information in Nutrition Apps
This repository contains an ontology developed for the bachelor thesis of Raluca Gavrila, part of the 43rd Twente Student Conference on IT. The goal of the research was to build a conceptual model of user informaton in diet applications. This ontology captures concepts such as user goals, preferences, motivation and habits, and aims to support behaviour change through personalization.
